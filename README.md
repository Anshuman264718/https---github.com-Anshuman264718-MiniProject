Tic Tac Toe is a game for two players, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3 x 3 grid traditionally. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game. It is a zero-sum of perfect information game. The optimal move for this game can be gained by using minimax algorithm, where the opposition between the utility functions makes the situation adversarial, hence requiring adversarial search supported by minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning concept in artificial intelligence.
